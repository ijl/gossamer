# Huxleeey

This tool allows you to create visual regression tests by browsing normally and taking screenshots. You needn't write Selenium tests, or make and keep in sync static pages for testing UI: this tool will test full webpages run on a development or testing webserver. We use it to test the UI of a Backbone single-page app. It uses Selenium WebDriver to run the tests, and can be run as part of continuous integration testing.
